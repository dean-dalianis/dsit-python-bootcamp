dear all 

please find attached the Fall Course assignments. I feel we have a very strong program and I'm Looking forward to an exciting semester, despite the special health issues we're facing.
Time, days and classrooms have been announced on our website: http://dsit.di.uoa.gr/
The semester starts on Monday Sept. 28. During the first week we offer the Python Boot Camp for 1st year students, so courses for them start on Monday Oct. 5. 
I assume you're all updating your class webpages (eClass is strongly encouraged) ! so you may include the starting date as well.
On Monday we're (physically) welcoming 1st year students at 4pm to 5pm at the Amphitheatre of the department of Informatics and Telecoms. You are all welcome to join!

thank you for your participation,
Yiannis
